Inventory-Currency-Combine<br>
By Rosska85<br><br>

One of the biggest annoyances I faced in Epoch was spending an hour separating and recombining my gold bars in my inventory, so I put this together from the 'Epoch change' script to allow players to combine their currency in ther inventory with one click.<br><br>

Installation
============
**Clean Epoch**<br>
Use this if you don't already have a custom compiles.sqf or anything which adds right click functions to items in your inventory.<br>

**Modded Epoch**<br>
